## Section 1: Introduction to Test Automation

Test automation is expected to help run many test cases consistency and repeatedly on different versions of the SUT and/or enviroments. But test automation is more than a mechanism for running a test suit without human interaction. 

### Test automation involves a process of designing the testware, including:

- Software
- Documentation
- Test Cases
- Test Enviroments 
- Test Data


### Testware is necessary for the testing activities that include:

- Implementing automated test cases 
- Monitoring and controlling the execution of automated tests
- Interpreting, reporting and logging the automated test results


### Test automation has different approaches for interacting with a SUT (System Under Test):

- API/Web Services: Testing through the public interfaces to classes, modules or lkibraries of the SUT (API Testing)
- User interface: Testing through the user interface of the SUT (e.g. GUI testing or CLI testing)
- Service/Protocol: Testing through the a service or protocol

### Objectives/Goal of test automation include:

- improving the test efficency
- Providing wider function coverage
- Reducing the total test cost
- Perfoming test that manual tester cannot
- Shortening the test execution period
- Increasing the test frequency/reducing the time required for test cycles


### Advantages of test automation include:

- More tests can be run per build (takes less time for automation to run tests)
- The possibility to create tests cannot be done manually (real-time, remote and parallel tests)
- Tests can be more complex (doing it manually can be complicated)
- Tests run faster 
- Tests are less subject to operator error
- More effective and efficent use of testing resources
- Quicker feedback regarding software quality
- Improved system reliability (repeatability, consistency, not prone to human error)
- Improved consistency of tests (Same results everytime)

### Disadvantages of test automation include:

- Additional costs are involved
- Inital investment to setup TAS
- Requires additional technologies
- Team needs to have development and automation skills
- On-going TAS maintance requirement
- Can distract from testing objectives (focusing on automatinmg tests casews at the expense of executing tests)
- Tests can become more complex
- Additional error may be introduces by automation

### Limitations of test automation include:

- Not all manual test cases can be automated
- The automation can only check machine-interpretable results
- The automation can only check results that can be verified by an automated test oracle
- Not a replacement for exploratory testing
