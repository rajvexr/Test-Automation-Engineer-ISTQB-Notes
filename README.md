## Introduction to Test Automation

Test automation is expected to help run many test cases consistency and repeatedly on different versions of the SUT and/or enviroments. But test automation is more than a mechanism for running a test suit without human interaction. 

### Test automation involves a process of designing the testware, including:

-> Software
-> Documentation
-> Test Cases
-> Test Enviroments 
-> Test Data


### Testware is necessary for the testing activities that include:

-> Implementing automated test cases 
-> Monitoring and controlling the execution of automated tests
-> Interpreting, reporting and logging the automated test results


### Test automation has different approaches for interacting with a SUT (System Under Test):

-> Testing through the public interfaces to classes, modules or lkibraries of the SUT (API Testing)
